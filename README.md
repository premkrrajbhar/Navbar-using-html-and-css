## Features

- **Sticky Navbar:** The navbar stays at the top of the page when you scroll.
- **Responsive Design:** The navbar adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Toggle Menu:** On smaller screens, the navbar items are hidden and can be toggled using a menu icon.
- **Custom Styling:** The navbar and its elements have custom styles, including background colors, font styles, and button designs.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Stylesheet language for designing the layout and appearance.
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for bars icons.
  
## Usage

To use this code in your project, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file to view the main structure of the navbar.
3. Ensure that `style.css` is located in the same directory as the HTML files to apply styling.
4. Customize `index.html` and `style.css` files according to your requirements.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure:** The navbar contains links and a button. A hidden checkbox is used to control the visibility of the navbar items on smaller screens.
- **CSS Styling:** Styles are applied to the navbar and its elements. Media queries handle the layout changes for different screen sizes.
- **Responsive Behavior:** On screens narrower than 768px, the navbar items are hidden and can be toggled with the menu icon.

## Customization

- **Brand Name:** Change the text inside the `<a href="#" class="icon">Brand Name</a>` tag to your desired brand or logo.
- **Navbar Links:** Modify the links inside the `.nav-links` div to fit your needs.
- **Styles:** Adjust the CSS to match your website's theme and style preferences.
